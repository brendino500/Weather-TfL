As we were both conscious of the absolute necessity to reduce the pollution levels in all major cities in the world, we decided to offer uses an efficient app returning:

-   Current Weather
-   Interactive Map with all available bike points
-   Information related to pollution metrics

---
## Challenges
* Implementing MapBox without being prior shown.
* Bulma - everything we tried was being overridden.
