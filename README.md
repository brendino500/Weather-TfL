## :page_facing_up: Technical brief
* 48 hour hack-a-thon in a paired group.
* **Have several components** - At least one classical and one functional.  
*  **The app can have a router** - with several "pages", this is up to your disgression and if it makes sense for your project.
* **Must use** a public API
* **Include wireframes** - that you designed before building the app.

As we were both conscious of the absolute necessity to reduce the pollution levels in all major cities in the world, we decided to offer uses an efficient app returning:

-   Current Weather
-   Interactive Map with all available bike points
-   Information related to pollution metrics

## :dart: Challenges
* Implementing MapBox without being prior shown.
* Bulma - everything we tried was being overridden.
